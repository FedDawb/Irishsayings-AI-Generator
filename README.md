## AI Irish Limerick Generator

# Overview

This project is a fun and interactive AI-powered Irish Limerick Generator that creates humorous and cheeky Irish limericks based on user input. Inspired by my Irish family humor, this app is designed to bring joy through AI-generated poetry while also improving my skills as a developer working with AI APIs, frontend development, and API integration.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end structure, styling, and interactivity

- Axios for making API requests

- SheCodes AI API for generating limericks

- Typewriter Effect for animated text display

- Netlify for hosting the project

- GitHub for version control and open-source collaboration

## Improvements and Features

1. Enhanced User Experience

- Interactive UI: A clean and simple design with an input field for users to specify a topic for the limerick.

- Real-time Feedback: Displays a fun loading message with a blinking animation while generating a limerick.

- Typewriter Effect: Smoothly animates the generated limerick for an engaging experience.

2. Improved API Handling

- Uses Axios to fetch AI-generated limericks dynamically.

- Provides detailed console logs for debugging and transparency.

- Ensures random and unique limericks each time by specifying creative prompts.

3. Thematic and Fun AI Prompting

- The AI is guided with a custom personality as an “Irish traditions expert” to generate authentic and humorous limericks.

- Automatically formats the output with spacing and a personalized signature message.

4. Stylish and Responsive Design

- Irish-themed aesthetics with a warm orange and white color scheme.

- Background Image of an Irish countryside for added immersion.

- Responsive layout that adapts well on desktop and mobile screens.

5. Deployment & Open Source

- Hosted on Netlify, making it accessible from anywhere.

- Open-sourced on GitHub, allowing collaboration and improvements.

## How It Works

- Enter a topic (e.g., "A leprechaun in Dublin").

- Click the Submit button.

- The AI generates and displays a unique limerick in a typewriter-style effect.

The limerick is signed off with a personal touch: "The gift of a smile from Dawn with the help of SheCodes AI."
